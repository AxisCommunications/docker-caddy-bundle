# Caddy with useful plugins

This project is for creating a docker image with
[Caddy 2](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) and additional useful plugins.

The generated docker image is based on the
[official Caddy2 image](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) and the plugins are
built using the corresponding caddy builder image.

## The added plugins

- [Caddy-Security](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security)

## Usage

This can be used in the same way as the
[official docker image](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy-docker). The
documentation for Caddy security can be found [here](https://authp.github.io/)
